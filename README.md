## Introduction
### What are skeleton loaders?
Skeleton loaders are visual placeholders for information while data is still loading. Anatomy. A skeleton loader provides a low fidelity representation of the interface that will be loaded.

### Motivation
Creating a skeleton-layout for your screens doesn't only feel like a duplicate work but things can go out of synce real quick, when updating the actual layout we often forget to update the corrosponding skelton-layout.


### How does it work?
As the name suggests, skeletonizer will reduce your already existing layouts into mere skeletons and apply painting effects on them, typically a shimmer effect. It automatically does the job for you, in addention SkeletonAnnotations can be used to change how some widgets are skeletonized.

### Support Skeletonizer
You can support skeletonizer by liking it on Pub and staring it on Github, sharing ideas on how we can enhance a certain functionality or by reporting any problems you encounter and of course buying a couple coffees will help speed up the development process.
